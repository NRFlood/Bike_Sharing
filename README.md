# Bike Sharing Analysis - Using Tableau to create visualizations 

## Overview of Bike Sharing Analysis

The purpose of this project is to build a dashboard that our friend Kate can use to pitch our bike sharing idea to the potential angel investor she has found.  To create the dashboard we pulled sample data from an existing bike sharing company - Citi Bike - in New York City.  The data covers an entire monthâ€™s worth of information that I used to generate visuals that tell a story about the usage of these bikes within the boroughs of NYC. To create these visuals I used Tableau to parse through the relevant information within the raw file and turn it into charts and maps that would highlight some key pieces of information that will help Kate and me build a business case for a bike sharing company in Des Moines.

Looking at the graph above it becomes clear that most of the people using these bikes are taking them for very short trips.  The most common amount of time for the bikes to be in use by any one user is 5 mins, indicating that most users are leveraging the bikes for commuting as opposed to leisure.

Similar to the first graph, this line graph provides a bit more context around how the different genders use the bikes, and for how long.  Both genders tend to use the bikes for similar amounts of time per trip (~5 mins), however it becomes clear in this graph that males tend to be much heavier users of the bike sharing available in the city.

Knowing that trip duration tends to be short for the majority of users, the heat map above provides some additional context regarding the time of day the bikes are begin used. The darker colors indicate heavier use, with the heat map suggesting that usage is heaviest during the start and end of the workday, with heavier usage on the weekends being spread out throughout the afternoon.

The heat map shading patterns are nearly identical for the two genders, with males being darker due to their heavier usage of the service.

When looking at the breakdown of the type of user by gender it provides additional support to males being the heaviest users of these bikes, as they tend to be the heaviest subscribers.  It stands to reason that if a user is willing to subscribe they intend to use the service frequently, in all likelihood for similar types of trips - perhaps to and from work.

Looking at the most common hours of usage for these bikes it again illustrates that people are using them at the beginning and end of the workday, again with males representing the heaviest usage as indicated by the orange section of each bar.

One final graph shows an interesting breakdown of which type of user tends to use the bike by station.  Areas that tend experience heavy tourism like Central Park, the Statue of Liberty and Wall Street appear to have a significantly higher amount of usage by "customers" as opposed to "subscribers."  This would make sense since tourists likely would not benefit from using a Citi Bike subscription.
