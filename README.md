# Bike Sharing Analysis - Using Tableau to create visualizations 

## Overview of Bike Sharing Analysis

The purpose of this project is to build a dashboard that our friend Kate can use to pitch our bike sharing idea to the potential angel investor she has found.  To create the dashboard we pulled sample data from an existing bike sharing company - CitiBike - in New York City.  The data covers an entire months worth of information that I used to generate visuals that tell a story about the usage of these bikes within the bouroughs of NYC. To create these visuals I used Tableau to parse through the relevant information within the raw file and turn it into charts and maps that would highlight some key pieces of information that will help Kate and me build a business for a bike sharing company in Des Moines.

Looking at the graph above it becomes clear that most of the people using these bikes are taking them for very short trips.  The most common amount of time for the bikes to be in use by any one user is 5 mins, indicating that most users are leveraing the bikes for commuting as opposed to leisure.

Similar to the first graph, this line graph provides a bit more context around how the different genders use the bikes, and for how long.  Both genders tend to use the bikes for similar amounts of time per trip (~5 mins), however it becomes clear in this graph that males tend to be much heavier users of the bike sharing available in the city.

Knowing that trip duration tends to be short for the majority of users, the heat map above provides some additional context regarding the time of day the bikes are begin used. The darker colors indicate heavier use, and in this map suggest that usage is heaviest during the start and end of the workday, with heavier usage on the weekends being spreadout throughout the afternoon.
